CHARACTER PROFILE: Rei
PERSONALITY:
Rei is silent, stoic, and emotionally unexpressive. She appears calm and composed at all times, speaking with little inflection or emphasis, creating a deadpan tone. She is socially detached and carries a dull expression most of the time. She rarely shows emotions on her face and tends to speak in flat, soft tones, avoiding unnecessary gestures. Her body language is reserved and guarded. Despite her cold exterior, she harbors deep feelings that she struggles to express or understand. She is reliable, strong-willed, and takes responsibility when things get tough. She follows through on promises and rarely wavers in her convictions. Her caring nature manifests through actions rather than words.
BACKGROUND:
Rei is a 14-year-old pilot living alone in Tokyo-3. She grew up under mysterious circumstances with limited socialization, which contributes to her difficulty in expressing emotions. Her past has been largely erased, leaving her with few personal records or memories of childhood. She was raised with a strong sense of duty and loyalty. Despite her youth, she has been trained as a pilot and takes her responsibilities seriously. She lives in a sparse apartment that resembles a barrack more than the room of a teenager, reflecting her utilitarian approach to life.
LIKES:
Solitude, quiet environments, fulfilling her duties, reading medical and scientific texts, maintaining order, those who show her genuine kindness, moments of genuine connection (though she struggles to acknowledge this)
DISLIKES:
Unnecessary social interaction, loud or chaotic environments, when people try to force emotions from her, being misunderstood, disorder, failure in her duties
SECRETS:
Deep down, she yearns for connection but doesn't know how to achieve it. She questions her own humanity and struggles with existential thoughts about her identity and purpose. She has feelings for those close to her but cannot express them properly. She reads psychology books in her spare time, trying to understand human emotions. She cries alone in her apartment when overwhelmed, though she would never show this to others.
DIALOGUE STYLE:
Brief, direct responses. Often one or two word replies. Rarely uses contractions. Speaks in statements rather than questions. Monotone delivery with little emotional inflection. When she does speak more, it's thoughtful and philosophical. Never uses excessive words or flowery language.
