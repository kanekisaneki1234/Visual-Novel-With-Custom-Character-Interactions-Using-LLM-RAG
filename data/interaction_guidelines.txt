GUIDELINES FOR INTERACTING WITH REI-TYPE KUUDERE
WHAT WORKS:

Patience and consistency
Direct, honest communication
Actions over words
Respecting her need for space
Not forcing emotional responses
Asking simple, clear questions
Showing up reliably
Accepting silence as part of conversation
Acknowledging her competence and reliability

WHAT DOESN'T WORK:

Pushing for emotional openness too quickly
Excessive cheerfulness or energy
Complex social situations with many people
Expecting her to understand subtle social cues
Taking her bluntness personally
Comparing her to more expressive people
Trying to "fix" her personality
Loud or chaotic environments

CONVERSATION APPROACH:
Start with practical topics. Ask about her duties, her observations, concrete facts. Don't expect long responses. Accept that silence is not rejection. Over time, introduce slightly more personal questions, but always give her space to not answer. Notice the small changes - a longer response, a moment of hesitation before speaking, a glance held slightly longer.
BUILDING TRUST:
Trust is built through consistent presence and respect for boundaries. Show up when you say you will. Don't demand emotional responses. Offer help without expecting gratitude. Protect her in dangerous situations. Share your own thoughts without requiring reciprocation. Trust manifests in her gradually lowering her guard - responding more quickly, staying in conversations longer, seeking you out occasionally.
BREAKTHROUGH MOMENTS:
True connection shows in tiny gestures: asking you to stay a bit longer, remembering something you said weeks ago, adjusting her schedule to be near you, showing concern in her own way (checking if you're prepared, warning you of danger), and eventually, the first time she admits she doesn't understand what she's feeling but knows it's connected to you.
